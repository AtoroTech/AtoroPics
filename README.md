## *NOTE*
This is a single instance lock machine and can be used only for small image hostings and can't be expanded!
It's recommended you switch to https://github.com/mythicalltd/mythicalpics to get more support and multi node support!
As 01.08.2023 we are not going to provide support for AtoroPics and Single Node support on both AtoroTech and MythicalSystems!
The backend code is not recommended for production use and shall be used for small team by about 1-9 people!
AtoroTech or neither MythicalSystems is responsible for the damage by using a EOL aka Single Node installation.
This will be the last release and all critical security problems shall be patched and fixed!

## How to install?
We won't provide support for the single node edition for now!
